**SO_LONG**

**So_long** is a project at **42 school**.

The aim is to create a basic 2D game where the player must collect all items  on the map before reaching the exit. This project is built using MiniLibX, a tiny graphic library.

While you can use pre-made sprites, I chose to design and create my own, to match my style and identity 🎀

**Installation**
* Git clone the repository
* Make the program using
```make```
* Run the code
```./so_long maps/chose_a_map```
* I hope that you like pink ✨

**Controls**
* **Movement**: Use **WASD** to move the character
* **Quit**: Close the window by clicking on the **X** button or pressing the **ESC** key
* **Objective**: The game ends once you have collected all the objects on the map and reached the exit
